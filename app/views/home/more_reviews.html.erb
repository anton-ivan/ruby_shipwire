								Thank you so much ! I just want to say that I’ve tried EVERYTHING to cover up my bald spots, and have been disappointed time after time. I am only 20 years old. So socially, it’s extremely rough for me if I have no solution. I’m more than happy to say that out of the 100+ products I’ve tried. Hair illusion has given me the most confidence! Again, THANK YOU

								I recently purchased your items and words cannot express how happy I am. I suffer from a hair condition called Achne Keloid nuchea and because of the embarrassment I was having to wear hats through all weathers, at work and playing sports. The only time my hat was off was during the comfort of my home and even when guests came round I would wear a hat or hood. It has been a real strain on my life but today thanks to your product I felt comfortable enough to leave my house with no hat after 6 years. What an amazing thing you have done for me and I just wanted to say thank you.

								This has to be the best product on the market of its kind. I’ve tried others and you could always tell there was smthg in your hair. With this product, it’s seamless. TOTALLY undetectable. I can only speak from a black male’s perspective. The jet black is a total life changer.

								What can I say man there is something special about this hair illusion in my mid 20’s my hairline started to receding I’m 30 yrs old now it’s abandon my scalp. it had me frustrated i tried almost entire hair loss product an none work tried to be a little more patient but it’s tough then when I tried hair illusion it’s like a miracle this product is for real it’s very simple i should’ve bought this stuff long time ago didn’t know it’ll work this good I Highly Recommend this product to those who losing their hairline or bald spot it works like magic just make sure you know your hair color and get some of that super hold spray so that way when you sprinkle hair illusion on your hairline or bald spot it’ll work like a charm if you’re planning on going outdoors it’ll be a good time to put on hair illusion but if you gonna be in your home all day you don’t have to use it only way it come off as if you decided to shampoo your hair it’s worth the money in my opinion take a chance try it for yourself an see if you’re satisfied or not.

								This product is by far better than any other fibers I’ve ever used. Toppik pales in comparison. Caboki is great but it is second. Hair illusion looks like real hair when you pour it from the bottle. I actually use my Toppik applicator for part of my application. GREAT product.

								I tried Toppik a while back and thought is was OK. Then i tried Dermmatch which i loved and still like a lot but i saw the pictures on Hair Illusions instagram and decided to give it a shot. When i first tried it, I didnt like it much and it seemed kind of messy but then i wondered how the hell the guys on instagram made it look so good. I tried it again with hair spray and was more skillful with how i put it on, let me tell you. When you get it right,… nothing looks better than this. I was really surprised how good it looked. I tried looking at it up close in the mirror under very bright lights and it seems the brighter the light, the more natural it looks. Same could be said in the Sun, looks more natural in the sun. Another note on this, i went out one night with it on… On my way home.. it started raining pretty hard. I said to myself “Oh F**k” but i was going home anyway so whatever… when i got home i looked in the mirror and it was STILL good. I credit this to the very strong hair spray i used called Bed Head, hard Head. That thing locks it DOWN!. Overall, fantastic product. I highly recommend this with a strong hairspray to keep it locked in. Also, it takes some practice but like i said, when you get it right… Nothing looks better. The only downside i have about this is the price, Could be a bit cheaper and i would buy more in bulk. Lower the price is this would be perfect.

								I am in my mid twenties and my hairline has been receding for a couple of years. I tried Biotin and other all natural products as well as expensive prescriptions and none of them worked. I was looking for other natural products when I came across Hair Illusion. I never heard of using real hair for a concealer so I purchased this product expecting very little. I was blown away on how natural looking and durable this product is. It blended so well my girlfriend of four years could not even tell what was different. I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning or receding hair.
